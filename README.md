基于 RISC-V 的人工智能处理器描述语言雏形设计
处理器描述语言是处理器设计过程中的重要工具，它能够以形式化的方式描述处理器的架构结构和行为特征，为处理器的建模、验证、仿真和实现提供统一的规范。然而，现有的处理器描述语言大多针对通用处理器设计，在支持人工智能特定特性方面存在不足，难以满足 AI 处理器设计的特殊需求。因此，设计一种基于 RISC-V 的、专门面向人工智能领域的处理器描述语言具有重要的理论意义和实际应用价值。围绕人工智能领域对处理器设计的特殊需求，提出了一种基于 RISC-V 架构的人工智能处理器描述语言雏形，旨在为 AI 处理器的架构设计和行为描述提供统一且高效的框架。
Prototype Design of Artificial Intelligence Processor Description Language Based on RISC-V
Processor description language is an important tool in the processor design process. It can describe the architectural structure and behavioral characteristics of a processor in a formal manner, providing a unified specification for the modeling, verification, simulation, and implementation of processors. However, most existing processor description languages are designed for general-purpose processors and have deficiencies in supporting the specific features of artificial intelligence, making it difficult to meet the special requirements of AI processor design. Therefore, designing a processor description language based on RISC-V and specifically tailored to the field of artificial intelligence has important theoretical significance and practical application value. Focusing on the special requirements of the artificial intelligence field for processor design, a prototype of an artificial intelligence processor description language based on the RISC-V architecture is proposed, aiming to provide a unified and efficient framework for the architectural design and behavioral description of AI processors.
